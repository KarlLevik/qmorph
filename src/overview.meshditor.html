MeshDitor is a GUI-featured automatic Finite Element mesh generator
implementing the Q-Morph algorithm. This implementation of MeshDitor
was developed as a part of my thesis for the degree of siv.ing. at
Department of Informatics, University of Oslo. What you are reading
now is the documentation for the source code of MeshDitor. The report
part of the thesis can be found in the <tt>docs/</tt> subdirectory of
the root directory.<br>
<br>
The paper describing the Q-Morph algorithm is titled "Advancing Front
Quadrilateral Meshing Using Triangle Transformations" (1998), and is
written by Steven J. Owen, Matthew L. Staten, Scott A. Cannan, and
Sunil Saigal. The Q-Morph algorithm uses some other algorithms, and
the two most important ones are "CleanUp: Improving Quadrilateral
Finite Element Meshes" (1997), written by Paul Kinney, and "An
approach to Combined Laplacian and Optimization-Based Smoothing for
Triangular, Quadrilateral and Quad-Dominant Meshes" (1998), written by
Cannan, Tristano, and Staten.<br>
