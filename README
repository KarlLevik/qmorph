This thesis is part of my siv.ing. degree project at the Dept. of
Informatics, the University of Oslo. Apart from an introduction to
the Q-Morph algorithm, as described in the paper
"Advancing Front Quadrilateral Meshing Using Triangle Transformations" 
by S.J. Owen, M.L. Staten, S.A. Canann, and S. Saigal,
the thesis consists of important background material, discussions of
every little aspect of the implementation, important results are
stated, figures of some of the example meshes, references, etc.

The thesis is found in the docs/ directory.

The project also includes a Java implementation of the Q-Morph
algorithm with a GUI called MeshDitor. 
 
The source code is found in the src/ directory.
The source code documentation is found in the srcdoc/ directory.

To ensure that the implementation works as described, it has been
tested on a number of different meshes. A discussion of these and
figures illustrating some of them are found in the thesis.

The meshes are found in the examples/ directory.

Run 'make' to build the source, source documentation and the thesis. 

To start the MeshDitor code, run 'java -jar meshditor.jar' in the bin/
directory, or simply run

make run

in the src/ directory. To test the Java Native Interface code, run

make jnirun

or go to the bin/ directory and execute

qmorph

with or without options or parameters.
