You will probably need at least Java 1.3.1 to compile.

The path to the Java libraries (jvm, jni and so on) 
needed for compilation of the C++ code, might not be 
correct for your system. You should verify that these
are set correctly in src/Makefile (the JDKPATH string), 
and also the paths in file src/qmorph.cpp
