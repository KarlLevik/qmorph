For the Java Native Interface C++ code to compile and run correctly, you 
need to have jdk1.3.1 or equivalent libraries. I do not think jdk1.4.0 
or higher will work. Also remember to update the JDKPATH in src/Makefile 
and also the paths in src/qmorph.cpp.

Now, to compile on Linux or any other UNIX system, all you have to do is 
executing

make
